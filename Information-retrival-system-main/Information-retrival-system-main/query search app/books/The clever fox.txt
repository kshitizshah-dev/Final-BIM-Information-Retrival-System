In a small village, there was a fox known for being sneaky. One night, the fox snuck into a chicken coop, hoping to steal some eggs. But the chickens were clever and set up a trap. When the fox got caught, the chickens offered him a deal: if he helped protect the coop from other thieves, they would share their eggs with him. The fox agreed, and soon, he became the coopâ€™s best guard, realizing that working together was much better than being sneaky.
