One sunny afternoon, Emma found a tiny kitten crying by the side of the road. It looked scared and hungry. Emma gently picked it up and decided to take it home. She named the kitten Whiskers and took care of it every day. Soon, Whiskers became her best friend. They played together, and Whiskers would curl up on her lap every night. Emma learned that small acts of kindness can lead to the best friendships.
